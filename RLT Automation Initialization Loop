msg * FACSDuet has successfully completed a 36-time initialization loop.



## Initialization loop - used to initialize software continuously. It launches the software, waits for initialization to complete, then exits the software and re-launches it, so that it can initialize once again.
I saved and ran this as a .cmd file (this is the extension for batch scripts).
